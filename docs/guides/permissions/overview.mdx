The Ory permission service [Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto) is based on the Google Zanzibar paper. It might differ a bit from
other authorization services you know, so lets first clarify a few concepts.

:::info Ory Cloud Availability

The permission service is available in Ory Cloud. The documentation, integrations and UI are currently being worked on,
but the API is production ready. Every existing and new project can use the service without extra fees or setup.

## Relations and Relation Tuples

The underlying data model are so-called [relation tuples](/keto/concepts/relation-tuples.mdx). They encode relations between [subjects](/keto/concepts/subjects.mdx)
and [objects](/keto/concepts/objects.mdx). Please head over to the individual pages for
more details.

Examples for relation tuples are:

- `user1` is `member` of `groups:group1`
- `member` of `groups:group1` is `reader` of `files:file1`

As you can see, the subject of a relation tuple can either be a specific subject ID, or subjects defined through an indirection
(all members of a certain group).

## Checking Permissions

Permissions are just another form of relations. Therefore, a permission check is a request to check whether a subject has a
certain relation to an object, possibly through one or more indirections.

Following the example above, one could ask:

- Is `user1` a `reader` of `files:file1`? - Yes, because `user1` is a `member` of `groups:group1` and all `member`s of `groups:group1` are `reader` of `files:file1`.
- Is `user2` a `member` of `groups:group1`? - No.

## Example

This example setup will guide you through the basic relation tuple management and check API usage. Please follow along, most easily with a [free Ory Cloud project](../console/create-project.mdx).

### Defining Namespaces

Relation tuples reside in [namespaces](/keto/concepts/namespaces.mdx). To create relation tuples, we first have to define their namespace.

````mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock'
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="Ory CLI" default>

```shell
ory patch permission-config <your-project-id> \
  --add '/namespaces/-={"id": 0, "name": "resources"}' \
  --add '/namespaces/-={"id": 1, "name": "groups"}'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-Hosted Ory Keto Config" default>

```yaml title=path/to/keto.yml
namespaces:
  - id: 0
    name: resources
  - id: 1
    name: groups
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

### Creating Relation Tuples

Now we can use the [relation tuple APIs](/reference/api.mdx#operation/createRelationTuple) to create a relation tuple.

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="Ory Cloud" default>

```shell
ORY_PAT="<your ory personal access token from the console>"
ORY_SDK_URL="<your ory project sdk url from the console>"

echo '[
  {
    "action": "insert",
    "relation_tuple": {
      "subject_id": "user1",
      "relation": "member",
      "namespace": "groups",
      "object": "group1"
    }
  }, {
    "action": "insert",
    "relation_tuple": {
      "subject_set": {
        "relation": "member",
        "namespace": "groups",
        "object": "group1"
      },
      "relation": "owner",
      "namespace": "resources",
      "object": "file1"
    }
  }
]' > relationtuple.json

curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ORY_PAT" \
  -d @relationtuple.json \
  "$ORY_SDK_URL/admin/relation-tuples"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-Hosted Ory Keto" default>

```shell
KETO_WRITE_URL="<your keto write url>"

echo '[
  {
    "action": "insert"
    "relation_tuple": {
      "subject_id": "user1",
      "relation": "member",
      "namespace": "groups",
      "object": "group1"
    }
  }, {
    "action": "insert"
    "relation_tuple": {
      "subject_set": {
        "relation": "member",
        "namespace": "groups",
        "object": "group1"
      },
      "relation": "owner",
      "namespace": "resources",
      "object": "file1"
    }
  }
]' > relationtuple.json

curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @relationtuple.json \
  "$KETO_WRITE_URL/admin/relation-tuples"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

### Checking Permissions

Permission checks are requests that check whether a subject has a relation to an object.
This relation can either be directly defined in the database, or indirectly inferred through transitive relations.

The [check API](/reference/api.mdx#operation/postCheck) allows to perform such checks:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="Ory Cloud" default>

```shell
ORY_PAT="<your ory personal access token from the console>"
ORY_SDK_URL="<your ory project sdk url from the console>"

echo '{
  "subject_id": "user1",
  "relation": "owner",
  "namespace": "resources",
  "object": "file1"
}' > query.json

curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ORY_PAT" \
  -d @query.json \
  "$ORY_SDK_URL/relation-tuples/check"
# should print:
# {"allowed":true}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="self-hosted" label="Self-Hosted Ory Keto" default>

```shell
KETO_WRITE_URL="<your keto write url>"

echo '{
  "subject_id": "user1",
  "relation": "owner",
  "namespace": "resources",
  "object": "file1"
}' > query.json

curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @query.json \
  "$KETO_WRITE_URL/relation-tuples/check"
# should print:
# {"allowed":true}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````
